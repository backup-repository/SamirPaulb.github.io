## Description

<p>Table: <code>Weather</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| city_id     | int  |
| day         | date |
| degree      | int  |
+-------------+------+
(city_id, day) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row in this table contains the degree of the weather of a city on a certain day.
All the degrees are recorded in the year 2022.
</pre>
