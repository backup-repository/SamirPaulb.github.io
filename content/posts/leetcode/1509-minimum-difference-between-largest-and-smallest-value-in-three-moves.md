# [1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves)


## Description

<p>You are given an integer array <code>nums</code>.</p>

<p>In one move, you can choose one element of <code>nums</code> and change it to <strong>any value</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of <code>nums</code> <strong>after performing at most three moves</strong></em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [5,3,2,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].
In the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].
In the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 5 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,10,14].
In the second move, change 10 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,14].
In the third move, change 14 to 1. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,1].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 1 - 0 = 1.
It can be shown that there is no way to make the difference 0 in 3 moves.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,100,20]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 100 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,20].
In the second move, change 20 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,7].
In the third move, change 3 to 7. nums becomes [7,7,7].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 7 - 7 = 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>-10<sup>9</sup> &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1

<!-- tabs:start -->

```python
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if n < 5:
            return 0
        nums.sort()
        ans = inf
        for l in range(4):
            r = 3 - l
            ans = min(ans, nums[n - 1 - r] - nums[l])
        return ans
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifference(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < 5) {
            return 0;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        long ans = 1L << 60;
        for (int l = 0; l <= 3; ++l) {
            int r = 3 - l;
            ans = Math.min(ans, (long) nums[n - 1 - r] - nums[l]);
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n < 5) {
            return 0;
        }
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        long long ans = 1L << 60;
        for (int l = 0; l <= 3; ++l) {
            int r = 3 - l;
            ans = min(ans, 1LL * nums[n - 1 - r] - nums[l]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

```go
func minDifference(nums []int) int {
	n := len(nums)
	if n < 5 {
		return 0
	}
	sort.Ints(nums)
	ans := 1 << 60
	for l := 0; l <= 3; l++ {
		r := 3 - l
		ans = min(ans, nums[n-1-r]-nums[l])
	}
	return ans
}
```
